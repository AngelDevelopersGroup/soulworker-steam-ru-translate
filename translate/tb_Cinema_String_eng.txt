Wha...what? A combat sim? Uh, nobody said anything about that!
A combat sim? What’re we waiting for?!
A combat sim? How barbaric.
I’ll get started then.\nBut this isn’t one of those insurance scams, right?
A combat simul... hm... is it this way?
Finally! I was beginning to think this place was all talk.

All I remember is that it was very peaceful. Peaceful, yes. Honestly...
The people were boring. Everything was about money.
All that mattered was what other people thought of you. What hypocrites.
Stomach grumbling, worker grumbles... \nFood eaten, worker purrs.
It was just like it is now. I had a lot of friends then, like I do here.
It’s been fifteen years. Dreams were forbidden.\nHow I hated it!

Hey... That’s...!
Another mystery. Will we ever know what happened beforehand...?
Yuck, I got something on my clothes.
Next time I’ll put you out of your misery.

Yuck... I’ll never get used to that stench.

Stop talking; let’s see some action.

Urgh, there’s just heaps of trash here, all of it making weird noises.

I went on an outing with friends, once. We had so much fun!
It was a huge G-22 transporter. They don’t build them any more.
No first class? Oh well, it’s a transporter, what did I expect?

A woman’s voice!\nNo matter. Just come here.

Where’s the present?\nCan’t you give me sweeties instead?
Something’s wrong with my eyes.\nI only saw naked skin.

Hm... Somehow I don’t feel like fighting you any more.

SoulDreg? That was not what we agreed, Henryk!

I... wasn’t aware of that either.
30122

Rubbish. How can you not have been aware of it? You were in charge of this place!
30123

Just because I was in charge doesn’t mean I knew everything that was going on.

Take it outside, you two.

Search for the members who disappeared. I’m detecting several energy signatures, so there is still hope.
30129

But something is wrong with these energy signatures.
30130
0
0
0
0
0

They are clearly human, but the way they move... the motion is similar to SoulDregs.

You’re not seriously saying...
30132

Humans and SoulDregs cannot merge. Everyone knows that. But it wouldn’t hurt to be careful.
30133
0
0
0

Hrmph! I find that difficult to believe. SoulDregs who are made of humans?
30134
0

0
0
0
0
Save them! We have to save them!
30135
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Stop it! Once they have become SoulDregs, it’s too late!
30136
0

0
0
0

Yes, I know. But still!
30137

Don’t forget. The objective is to collect samples. If he sees you, you won’t succeed.

Do you think he’s really coming?

No. You don’t need to. You can tell it’s NED Company property just from looking at it: it’s obvious.

Impossible!

The energy signature... I lost it.
30177

I can’t find it any more. You’d better get back here for now.
30178

We were too late.

Shade! What are you on about?
30180
0
0
0
0
0
0

Too late! Are you telling me she’s still unhurt, after all this time? Optimism should be grounded in reality!
30181

Lieutenant Colonel Aaron is listening! Pull yourself together!
30182

Do you think I want to say this? I have calculated it over and over, and that’s the result so live with it!

Shade! You...!
30184
0

0

Both of you, stop it.
30185
0
0
0
0

But...
30186
0
0
0
0

Please stop it.

Heh? The energy signature... it’s back! It is identical to Catherine’s code.
30188

0
0
0
0
R...really?! How is she?
30189
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
She’s still too far away to tell! I’ll know more once we get closer!
30190
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Catherine is in range! I’ll scan her body!
30191
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
And? How is she doing? Is she unhurt? She hasn’t been infected?
30192

...!
30193
0

Wh...why don’t you answer? I asked you a question! Answer me!

Are we... too late?
30196
0
0
0
0

No, we’re not. We’ll find a way.

What a huge house. Imagine it was yours!
30201
0
0
0
0
0
0

This house... it’s a spider’s den. The view on the screen is enough to give me the shivers.
30202

0
0

0
0
0
Stop it! I don’t want to hear this any more!
30203

Did you know that? If steel were as thin as a spider web, the spider web would be stronger and withstand more strain.
30204

0
0
0
0
What are you babbling on about?
30205
0
0
0
0
0

It means a spider can overpower prey that is as big or even bigger than itself.
30206

0
0
0
Hey, why are you telling me this stuff?
30207
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
I’m just trying to tell you to be careful. The spiders in the house might be as big as humans.
30208
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
You! You derive a perverse joy from explaining this sort of stuff, don’t you?
30209
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
I didn’t expect you SFL guys to make it this far.\nI have one condition: no matter what, don’t touch the black pupae in the lab.
30210
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Destroy them.
30211
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
What?
30212
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
I’m not going listen to you any more. Destroy them. We must know what’s behind all of this.
30213

You seem to live and breathe deception.
30214
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
See the big capsule ahead of you? Examine it. Find out what it is.
30215
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
No. It doesn’t need to be examined. Go back!
30216
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
You really have to take things to extremes, don’t you!
30217
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Examine it. We want to know too.
30218
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
And? Are there peculiarities?
30219
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Damn... it’s gone!
30220
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
What? What’s gone?
30221
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Am I obliged to tell you that?
30222
0
0
0

Oh, it doesn’t matter. We’ll find out.

Luke III’s energy signature has disappeared again! Search the surroundings!
30224
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Did it really absorb the people?
30225
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Damn, then it’s really escaped.
30226
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Hey, Fatso! Tell me what this is.
30227
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
It’s a parasite that absorbs people’s SoulForce. If it finds SoulForcers and SoulWorkers...
30228
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
What then?
30229
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Then it will absorb them as well. To them, those people are a kind of vitamin boost.
30230
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
And you guys created this?
30231
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
It was a failed experiment. You must not face it. It will drain you until you are dead.
30232

There, a Malevil signature! Why is the NED Company keeping a Malevil here?
30233
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Henryk, what were you guys up to in this place?
30234
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
I am not required to tell you that. Just keep on with your mission.
30235
0
0
0
0
0
0

Luke III’s signature is coming from this pupa. Kill the Malevil and rescue him!
30236

0
0
0
0
0
Malevil escaping!
30237
0
0
0
0
0

Abort pursuit! Luke III’s rescue has top priority!
30238

0

Search for code name Mad Manic!
30239
0
0
0

Remember: regardless of whether you find him, the lab will be detonated on schedule.
30240

0

0
0
0
0
Hey! What’s taking you so long? Activate the damn detonator!
30241
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
You don’t have much time. You need to get out of the shelter before it blows up!
30242
0
0
0
0
0

Mad Manic is incoming! The shelter will be blowing in a minute! Victory with a single strike!
30243

It’s oozing in! The secretion! Let’s take a look at it!
30244

0

0
0
0
0
Secretion secured! Hurry up and get out of there!
30245

Phew, that was close.
30246
0
0
0
0
0
0

Well done. Now come back.
30247
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Well, Luke III? How do you like it at your old workplace?
30248
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Haha. I used to do research for the NED Company. But I didn’t last long there.
30249

The rumour is: he was thrown out because of sexual harassment.
30250
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
You’re going out on a limb there. I gave notice because I didn’t agree with the NED Company’s inhumane activities.
30251
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
But I bet you enjoyed a hefty salary, didn’t you? Don’t you regret losing it?
30252
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
In this world, money isn’t worth anything any more. Plus, I like my new job much better.
30253
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Hm. If you like it, that’s good enough.
30254
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
That they would carry out experiments like that in the city... I guess they don’t care about people’s safety.
30255
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
The city is as good as lost, so it would hardly be noticed.

Shade.
30257
0

It’s true! This city has had it.
30258

0
0

Shade.
30259
0

Sorry. I shouldn’t have said that.

Incidentally, isn’t this the perfect place for Seoni?
30261
0
0
0

0
0
0
No, I don’t mean it like that. Just a thought.
30262
0
0
0
0
0

I’ll find the location of the control unit immediately! Go to the end of the air-raid shelter, to the central control room!
30263
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Strange... Something about that was strange.
30264
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Yes. Why did the SoulDreg explode so suddenly? There must be a reason...
30265
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Yes. Otherwise the phenomenon would be inexplicable.
30266
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
I agree. I just hope nothing bad happens.
30267

Control unit is activated! G-22. Positioning the catapult!

The SoulDregs are closing in on Catherine! Quick! Hurry!

Catherine is in the control centre! She hasn’t recovered yet. Hurry!
30270

That’s the SoulDreg from the shelter! Be careful!
30271

The refugees are on board! Kill the remaining SoulDregs!

Oh, Lieutenant Colonel Aaron is injured!

Those damned SoulDregs!
30274

They are pursuing the other transporters, too! Prepare for impact!

Argh... How did he get in here? Luke III!
30276

Yes! He’s after Catherine!
30277

Did you hear that? This time I will kill you once and for all!

Soul Reaver has fled to the transporter’s top deck.

Go after him! Annihilate him!

To the top deck! Please go to the top deck! Quick!

Have you heard of Grace City?
30290

0

Grace City in is the western part of Cloudream. It’s the only place where you can still see blue sky. I’d like to show it to you one day.

The test sim is just being activated.\nFirst, activate the control unit in front of you.
30294

Gate opened! Let’s start with the physical test.\nI’ll load the visual object so you can destroy it.

Training dummy loaded!\nStarting combat sim!
30297

It’s only a combat sim, it’s not dangerous. So don’t worry.
30298

Huh... strange. The measured data is off the charts.\nOh, don’t mind me. Continue to the next test, please.
30299

This is the combat sim for advanced fighters.\nDestroy all training dummies set up in this sector!
30300

It’s a magnetic field which we call the SoulForce Shield.\nYou have to use a skill, you can’t destroy it otherwise.
30301
0
0
0
0
0

I’ll send you the instructions for using your skills to your control unit.\nDon’t worry, you can try as many time as you like!

Sorry! Now we just need to run the last test. Not much longer now!
30304

Nobody governs this sector, so it’s basically lawless. We call it District 6.\nAnything can happen here and nobody will help you. So watch out!

30309
0

You don’t have much combat experience yet, so it’s a good idea to start acquiring some fighting the Bashai.\nInitial experience is important, so please take this seriously.

Hey, policeman! Over here!

And the points?
30316

Listen, novice.\nHow many points do you think there are?

Err...
30318

Hehe, our little one here worked hard.

I can see the bloodlust in your eyes.\nThe report on you didn’t mention that.

Hey, sweetie! Are you going to let the SoulWorker get away with that?\nYou’re the operator! Can you do it?

Yes... but...!
30325

I’m scanning the vehicle.\nIt’s... empty! There’s nobody inside!
30329

And the Bashai are coming.\nWas that their fate?

The bag? Why?
30337

Did you notice the Bashai? They weren’t after the novice; they wanted the vehicle.\nThey were looking for something. Bring me whatever is inside the bag.

Operation Planetary Defence against code name Sukkarak commencing.\nHe’s the Firestream leader, so you have to...
30339
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Stop it.
30340

I know you can’t do that to Catherine, but these things happen!\nNo matter how cold-hearted that sounds!
30341
0
0
0
0
0
0

Just because it happens a lot doesn’t mean we should ignore it.\nWhy aren’t you giving it a rest?
30343
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Get used to it. Catherine is dead and revenge isn’t going to change that.\nYou don’t need to give up on revenge, but don’t lose yourself to it.
30344
0
0
0
0
0

Focus, and look after yourself when you make him pay.\nThat’s the best revenge.
30345

Sorry.\nI shouldn’t have said that.

Uh, what?
30347

Exactly!
30348

These young people...
30350
0

It’s Sukkarak!\nIt doesn’t look like he’s got the will to fight...
30351

Whenever I see the motorway...\nit reminds me of when I was a teenager. The wind blowing. Riding my motorbike...
30353
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
The setting sun egging me on to go even faster.\nAs if it were competing with me to see who was faster.
30354
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
I lost, of course.\nThe way the orange sun sank beneath the horizon... a beauty so great I forgot how fast I was going.

Nonsense, you don’t even have a driver’s licence.

Ava! You are so unromantic!
30358

What are you talking about? Anyway, motorbikes aren’t allowed on the motorway.

Oh, stop fighting.
30360

Gosh... I’m tired.
30361

Um, did you have to go and say that over the comms system?
30362
0

0
0
0
Oops, sorry, sorry. Stupid habit.
30363
0
0
0
0
0

Why are you always so tired? Do you work a lot?
30364
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Hm? No, I’ve got a lot of time.\nMy employees do all the hard work, anyway... *yawn*
30365
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Then why are you tired all the time?
30366
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Sleep a lot and you’ll grow big and strong!\nI want to be as big as Ava, so I have to sleep a lot.
30367

0
0
0
0
0
0
Hehe, true. Captain Ava is really big. Great.
30368
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
No, I didn’t mean her size.
30369
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
No? What then?\nAh.
30370
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Yes. Ava is... really big! I’ve seen something like it before.
30371
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Now go to sleep.
30372
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Yes. I’m going to bed.
30373
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Henryk definitely did something here.\nBut naturally even I don’t know what it was.
30374
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
That was just the beginning. Kill the Firestream troops inside.\nI’ll estimate from the size how many troops are inside.
30375
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Oh, I can do that too!\nI...if you wait a bit, I can tell you right away...
30376
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
I don’t mean to be impolite, but.... please leave this to me.\nIt was our mistake, so we must rectify it.
30377
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Uh, yes.
30378

Lost...
30379

...
30381
0
0
0
0
0
0

The facilities are excellent.\nEverything is clean, the equipment is good... you don’t want to break any of it.
30382

0
0
0
0
Traitor! The traitor is here!
30383
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
The building leaves a sour taste in the mouth all the same. Like a fortress built over the graves of its victims.\nBut yes, the facilities are top of the line.
30384

Thanks. The NED Company’s first priority is to look after its staff.
30385
0
0

0
0

That was not a compliment.
30386

Commencing the operation to secure the power supply!\nThere are four emergency power generators!
30387
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Once all four are activated, the secondary generator will be ours.\nBut we’ll need the security key to control the main generator.
30388
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Most likely, Venin on the top floor has the security key.\nActivate the power supply and then overpower Venin.
30389
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
I’ll recap: we need you to activate the four emergency generators and get the security key from the leader on the top floor.
30390
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Commander, can you see that?
30391
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Yes. Both of them love being operators!
30392
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
By activating the emergency power generators, we have taken control of the secondary generators.
30393
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Now we just need the security key to the main generator.
30394
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
It’s very likely that Venin on the top floor is the one who has the security key.
30395
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
He won’t just hand it to you, so you’ll have to fight him.
30396
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Commander, can you see that?
30397
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Yes. This contest is going to end in a disaster!
30398
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
It is Venin.
30399
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
She’s got the security key.
30400
0
0

0
0
0
You wasted your energy with your fights.\nBe smarter next time!
30401

0
0
0
0
0
Wait! Be quiet.
30402
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Obtained security key.
30403

0
0
0
0
0

Come back.
30404

By taking control of the main generator... Oh, Chloe, maybe you should handle this.
30405
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
N... no. It’s best if you do this, Rawper.
30406
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
I’m not the usual operator. Of course, you’re much better at it than me, Chloe.
30407
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
But nobody knows their way around the NED Company like you, Rawper. I’m counting on you!
30408
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
No. That doesn’t make sense. Chloe, you really should...
30409
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
No, you, Rawper...
30410
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
My goodness, I’ll do it.\nNovice, listen up. The main generator is ours, so the lift is working.\nGo to the security floor and get the data Henryk copied.

The NBRF have arrived. They are covering you, so be careful.

Second reinforcements starting. Attack.

My stomach feels queasy. As if I haven’t been to the toilet in two days.
30419
0
0
0
0
0
0

It’s undamaged? It wasn’t guarded, even though what it contains is so critical that only the leaders have the key?
30420

0
0
0
Eh? I scarcely mentioned it and my stomach’s grumbling already.
30421

0

I’m not very happy about this.\nThere’s not much we can do right now. You secure the data.

Ava. Go to the toilet for me, will you?
30423

Leave me alone!

I’m sending the likely target position to your control unit!\nI repeat: They do not distinguish between friend and foe.

No, I’m feeling better because I’ve been to the toilet.

Oh, sorry. I didn’t mean to compliment the enemy... It was thoughtless of me.

Nobody likes working.\nEverybody here just wants to survive.\nGot it?

Oh, forget that I said anything.
30446

Stop!

Oh, yes! What? Why on earth?
30451

We have been preparing for this operation for a long time.\nThe manual cannot possibly cover all aspects.
30452

0
0
0
Uh, yes? I had some questions, anyway...
30453
0
0
0

That’s why we’ll be taking support from here. You can get some rest.
30454

What? But I’m still...
30455

Don’t worry, it’s nothing personal.

Uh... yes, okay.\nWell, good luck!

Yeah, yeah.
30458

Shut up.\nNo small talk when I’m doing support.

The next one to open their mouth without my say so will be hit with sonic waves only teenagers can hear.\nI’m over 30 - I won’t hear them.

The Mountain Troll isn’t progressing because of all the rubble.\nWe’ll use explosives to clear the debris and secure its route.

Hey, didn’t I say nobody talks here without my permission?\nLet’s see... how do I activate the sonic waves?
30463
0
0
0
0
0

I’ll let you off generously this time.\nBut it’s the last time I’ll do that. Okay?

Good.\nGood students.

Good. The way has been secured.\nLex, I’m ready.
30468

Hm... you should come back.\nIt will take a while for me to adjust the coordinates. *yawn*
30469
0

0
0
0
0
What? Why didn’t you do that beforehand?
30470
0
0
0
0

Did I know that an idiot would personally set off the blast?\nEven a genius like me can’t safeguard against an idiot.
30471

Did you hear that, idiot? You can come back now, idiot.

Argh, you’re really mean, Ava.

Ungh. What are you talking about? You don’t even fight.

Can’t somebody just shove me into the Great Void?
30481

Here it is. Once we’re done here, we can determine the angle for firing the rockets.\nThe timing has to be perfect. Just a fraction too late, and...

The angle is fine! The distance is fine! The timing is fine!\nEverything’s fine. Let’s go!

No problem, no problem.\nThat’s why it’s even more important.

As expected, we succeeded in provoking Falconai.\nThen again, anybody would be upset to find their car damaged.

So do you think everything is okay? Maverick isn’t answering either.

Oh, sweetheart. Don’t you trust your partner?\nDo you think your partner is so weak that nothing will go right without Maverick around?
30495

0
0

Uh, no! No, I didn’t mean that.
30496

Didn’t I tell you to go get some rest? Why are you being such a busybody?\nWant me to give you a dose of sonic waves, too?
30497

0
0

No! I’ll get some rest! See you!
30498

Hmph. She’s needs to rest! Why doesn’t she listen to me?
30499

All right, you can talk now. There was some educational value in that.

The operation objective is simple. You have to defeat Falconai. That’s all.\nAny questions? No? Then get going!
30501

Drat. The controls aren’t working from here, yet again.\nNovice, you’ll have to clear the way yourself.

See that lever? All you have to do is pull it. Easy-peasy, right?

Hey, Novice.
30504

0

Take it easy, I’m not going to eat you. If somebody sees that they’ll think I’m torturing you.

Did you know that the cutie looked after another SoulWorker before you came along?
30506
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
The SoulWorker was the same age as you...\nHe died a senseless death.\nHe was surrounded by Bashai and was hit by friendly fire...
30507

The girl acts happy, but in reality she worries about you all the time.\nTo see a partner die... nobody gets over the loss easily.
30508
0
0

Make sure you don’t disappoint her.\nYou know what I mean, don’t you? Don’t just walk out there and die.

I’ve been talking at you for much too long.\nFalconai is ahead of you. Make sure you defeat him.

Falconai sighted! Give it everything you’ve got.

It’s fascinating that there are sounds only audible at a certain age.\nThis is the device that gives you teenagers a hard time.

Eh?\nWhat is it, commander?

You didn’t just go and press that, did you?
30519

Can’t you behave your age for once?
30520

I hate bird droppings.
30521

Commander. Do you have to bring up such a gross subject?
30522

0
0
0
0
0

Worst of all, you can’t defend yourself against it.\nFirst, there’s its consistency. Second, it falls out of the sky silently and without warning.\nThen you have to contend with the direction of the wind!\nI guarantee you, not even a SoulWorker can evade it.

Hey! I said, stop it.
30524

Do you know what happened in summer?\nI unbuttoned my shirt to cool off, and guess what?\nBird droppings landed, splat, right on my chest!
30525

Will you stop it?!
30526

Search operation commencing!\nThe rain is impairing visibility, so be careful!
30527

Standing in the pouring rain, now that’s what I call being young!\nAnd the soaked white t-shirt reveals...
30528

0
Chest hair?
30529

Clothes? Hm, bring them along. They may give us a clue.
30530

How impolite. A hot-blooded couple surrendering to the passion of the moment...
30531

Let’s see... Where did I put the number to call the SFL about sexual harassment?

Be quick about setting up the SoulPath markers.\nYou need to place them at A-3, C-12, C-17 and D-1!\nThere might still be survivors. You mustn’t waste any time!
30533

0
0

0

Eh?
30534
0
0
0

Well... People’s lives are at stake.\nI’m not just play-acting the leader here.
30535

Pointless small talk is banned until we know more about the situation!\nFocus on the mission and nothing else!
30536
0

The SoulPath markers have been set up.\nI will search for SoulForce in the vicinity!
30537

Scanning results: minor energy signatures located!\nUp ahead!
30538

Go there! There’s no time to lose!
30539
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
What have they done?!
30540
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
The survivors’ energy signatures... all of them have vanished.\nThey have to be within Taifon...
30541
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Were they absorbed?
30542
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Destroy them.
30543
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
That’s an order. Don’t overlook any, annihilate every single one of them!
30544
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Straight ahead of you... I’m detecting large quantities of SoulForce.
30545
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Are those survivors?
30546
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
No. Just like before... It’s just an energy form.
30547
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
...
30548
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Novice. Go.\nGo and put an end to this.
30549
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
That column...\nChloe, can you examine it?
30550
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Yes, I’ve already finished scanning.\nThe energy emanating from the column... uh...
30551
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
What’s that? Tell me!
30552
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
It’s SoulForce.\nAs in the SoulForce that normally only humans possess.
30553
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
They’ve used it to create a shield.\nSoulForce has always had powerful protective characteristics... which they are using.
30554
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
As soon as the SoulForce comes into contact with the power of the Bashai, it is reduced to 0.\nThey cancel each other out.
30555
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Try to direct Taifon’s attack toward the column.\nAs soon as his energy comes into contact with the SoulForce, it will be nullified and his shield briefly deactivated.
30556
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
The attack here is useless. SoulForce cannot harm other SoulForce.\nTry to drive Taifon’s attack toward the column.
30557
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Unbelievable. With a single strike...
30558
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
I told you, I’m not just play-acting the leader.
30559
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
It’s over... Get his things and come back.\nGood work.
30560
0
0
0

We’re reading large quantities of SoulForce at the square in Deaf Town.\nThey are equivalent to that of a SoulWorker.
30561

0
0
0
Those scumbags... How much do they want to grab?
30562
0
0
0

0
0
0
The inhabitants of a mid-sized city zone have disappeared...
30563
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Has their pride sunk to such depths? Revolting! These Firestream rogues.
30564
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Like I said, I have no idea what they plan to do with such a huge amount of SoulForce.\nBe careful.
30565
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Come on. We have to see for ourselves what they are up to.\nAnd... promise me this.
30566
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Exactly!
30567
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
That signature! That’s... Sukkarak!
30568
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Sukkarak? But he was on the motorway and...
30569
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
...crashed off the bridge.
30570
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Oh right! He did.
30571
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Yes.
30572
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Then he must have prepared for a rematch.
30573
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
So the incidents seem to be connected.
30574
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
That’s... Naomin!
30575
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Does the Firestream have two leaders? Evidently there is more to this than meets the eye!
30576
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
The energy signature is peculiar! That’s a...
30577
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
A fusion of SoulForce and Bashai! Is that even possible?
30578
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
A man who gave up his pride?
30579
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Bashai and humans share many characteristics.\nEspecially because they draw upon the power of the heart.\nThe stronger a heart, the greater the power... This is the law on which the world has turned ever since the Great Void.
30580
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
It’s your own fault! You didn’t want to ask about the source of your power.\nLook where your stubbornness has brought you.\nYou’ve disavowed yourself.
30581
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Beat it. You pitiful Bashai. You are nothing but an empty shell.
30582
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
The operation is over. Come back.
30583

Our Novice. You made a real impression today.
30584
0

It’s true. Probably some praise is in order.
30585

The people of Grace City are highly skilled.
30586

Woah!
30588

Why? I said, keep it up.\nGo on, praise us, glorify us and pay homage to us.

Nah... Not now.
30590

What’s this about? How boring.
30591
0
0
0
0
0

It’s raining.\nI hate rain.
30592
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Yes. Me too.\nIt makes my bones hurt.
30593
0
0
0
0
0
0

Hehe... I guess that’s proof we’re getting older.\nRain never bothered me when I was little.
30594
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Never mind. At least we grew up to be great women.
30595
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Right! Speaking objectively, we’ve become fabulous women!
30596
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Yes. We are fabulous women.
30597
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
I feel lonely, somehow. C’mon, I’ll make some tea!\nWe can drink to us being such amazing women.
30598
0
0

Rubbish, we’ll get some guys to join us! Guys!
30599
0

Uh, you do realise we’re in the middle of an op, don’t you?
30600
0

0
0
0
0
Uh... sighted! The Firestream Battalion!
30601
0
0
0
0
0

They seem to have been looking for us...\nKill them before more of them come.
30602

Hm... Funny?
30603
0

0
0
0
0
What’s funny?
30604
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
We should contact the vanguard.
30605
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
You mean we’ve got a traitor in our midst?
30606
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Chloe dearest?
30607
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Unable to establish contact with the vanguard.\nLooks like something happened.
30608
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Then there really is a spy?
30609
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Maybe.\nBut it isn’t one of us. I’m sure about that.
30610
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Yes. I agree. At least, I want to.\nThat means that...
30611
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
I need to talk to Rawper.
30612

Operation to rescue the isolated troops commencing.\nMultiple signatures from survivors! It’s not too late. Hurry!
30613
0
0
0
0
0
0

First enter the current sector and then go straight to the anticipated meeting point!\nJoin the support unit.
30614
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Yes. I’m going! If there is even the slightest chance people survived, we have to go there!
30615
0
0
0
0
0
0

The meeting point isn’t much further!\nProbably, several Firestream troops are planning an ambush on the route.

Can you hear me, sweetie?
30617

Yes! I can hear you. Speak!
30618
0
0
0
0
0
0

Yop and Medo have contacted us!\nThe situation is bad, but there are a few survivors.
30619

0
0
0
0
Really?\nWhat’s the current situation?
30620
0
0
0
0

They are surrounded by the Killer Squad!\nThey are still able to defend themselves, but it’s only a matter of time!
30621

0
0
0
0
0
Novice! Did you hear that?\nGet going!
30622
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
A...all the soldiers...
30623
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
We have to hurry.
30624
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
D...dead?\nSo quickly?
30625
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Kurisu...\nNot dead yet, I see.
30626
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Medo is alive!\nBut Yop...
30627
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
He’s dead!
30628
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Uh, no. That’s not true!\nI’m going to keep searching for signs of life!
30629
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Sweetie...\nYop is dead.
30630

0
0
0
0
0

...
30631
0
0
0
0
0
0

Is he talking? Kurisu...?
30632
0
0

Kurisu is silent!\nSave Medo!

What if roads were made from mobile blocks?\nYou could add curves or inclines as the need arises.
30634
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Ooooh... That doesn’t look bad.
30635
0
0
0
0
0
0

You wouldn’t have to excavate the ground and could build roads anywhere.\nIt would be convenient for the army, too, wouldn’t it?
30636
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Right, it would be revolutionary.\nAva, you always come up with such brilliant ideas.
30637
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Don’t I, though?\nShall we make it an official project?
30638
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Great idea.\nSo of what will the blocks be made?
30639
0
0
0
0
0
0

I guess you’ll need to think of something.

The NED Company sat on a wall, the NED Company had a great fall.

All the king’s mannequins and all the king’s men couldn’t put the NED together again.\nOr something like that! I bet they’re not putting anything together.

I’m pretty sure the secret base is near here.

Oh, why so? Explain.

30668

Here it is. You were right.\nThat must be their secret base. I have detected an energy signature.

I hacked the system but the door still won’t open.

There’s nothing we can do about that.\nHm... Would explosives help?
30671

0

Then we’d best make use of the bird rocket!
30672
0
0
0
0
0
0

Come back first.\nThere are several ways to open that door. First of all, we can be happy we found the base at all.

The EMP bomb may be small, but it’s powerful.\nI guarantee it will be a success. After all, the NED Company built it.

The day when humans can control the SoulDregs is near. Thanks to you and the brat.\nWell, I guess I should send you a badge of gratitude. Or would you prefer a statue? Titled, ‘The SoulWorker who paved the way for the future’.\nWell? Sound good? Hahahaha!

The diversion succeeded. That means I can eat the jerky.\nIf you tell on me, I’ll blast you with sonic waves.

This isn’t the strength of an ordinary mutant...!\nSo it’s... you...! You are the one Flamar spoke of.

And I was just wondering what is all that noise about? I guess a mutant has arrived.\nShow your face.

Hehe. Come up to the roof and take a look at it.\nAs your reward, I will show you how grown-ups fight.
0
50155
0
0
0
0
0
0
Oh, you actually came?\nI guess I should reward you for that.
0
50156
0
0
0
0
0
0
Oh, yeah, I swatted the gnats back there because they were going on my nerves.\nRight... What’s the best way to torment you?
0
50157
0
0
0
0
0
0
Hahaha... the child is funny. I think I get why he’s so fond of it.\nWell, then... let’s see what it can do to amuse me, shall we?
0
50158
0
0
0
0
0
0
Ooh, you’re better than I thought.\nNext you’ll have me flat on my back, hm?
0
50159
0
0
0
0
0
0
I haven’t felt something like this in a long time.\nIt would be a shame to kill you now.
0
50160
0
0
0
0
0
0
Hm, that should do for now.\nI’ll be late for my date otherwise.
0
50161
0
0
0
0
0
0
Grown-ups are always busy.\nSee you soon. Man.
0
50162
0
0
0
0
0
0
I was hoping\nyou would be good.
0
50163
0
0
0
0
0
0
Never judge an adversary by their appearance.\nSee that killing machine over there... I’m going to have him for breakfast!
0
50164
0
0
0
0
0
0
Great! Finally a real opponent!\nCalling me a mutant is an insult.
0
50165
0
0
0
0
0
0
And the kid!\nGet ready to die on my sword!
0
50166
0
0
0
0
0
0
Argh! What a fabulous fight!\nBut... a pity...
0
50167
0
0
0
0
0
0
You are too stupid to realise who your true enemy is.\nI’ll have your head!
0
50168
0
0
0
0
0
0
Whilst you are here, we are making progress!
0
50169

0
0
0
0
0
Uoooooh!!!
0
50170
0
0
0
0
0
0
You’re earlier than I expected.\nI guess I’ll have to play for time.
0
50171
0
0
0
0
0
0
Hehe, don’t you wonder\nhow a man without pride can be reborn?
0
50172
0
0
0
0
0
0
It should be fine now.\nI’ll be leaving.
0
50173
0
0
0
0
0
0
You fool...\nDon’t you dare die. Return victorious.
0
50174
0
0
0
0
0
0
Hm.
0
50175
0
0
0
0
0
0
Is that the power you humans possess?\nNow I understand how your race grew to be so strong.
0
50176
0
0
0
0
0
0
Let’s go! Won again!\nI cast away my pride... and everything else... for you. Don’t disappoint me!
0
50177
0
0
0
0
0
0
Huh, what?\nMy power should equal yours... be even greater, in fact!
0
50178
0
0
0
0
0
0
Oh... Ooooohhh!!\nToo soon! It cannot end like this!
0
50179
0
0
0
0
0
0
My power is leaving me?\nIt...it’s rejecting me!

You’re supposed to say that Ravan is buying you time.

Ravan has to play for time.
0

Ravan. Playing for time.

60117

0
0
0
0

Th...then it was pointless? But I’m not going to give up! I’ll try again!
60118

0
0
0
0
0
Phew, what a combination.
60120

Heh? Huh? Where did he come from?
60121

Hahaha! Everyone! I’m all right! Hahaha!
60122

Sigh... oh... I knew... knew... you would come. Oh... dear...
60123

Haha! Phew... saved!
60124

Oh... Tha...thanks! That almost didn’t work out.
60125

0
0
0
Are you really all right?
60126
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
That’s what I said! You’re the one who’s nervous, Luke III.
60127
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Then there’s just one final question I want to ask you.
60128
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Well really! Yeah, yeah, I’m fine, I really am!
60129
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Are you by any chance hearing a voice in your head?
60130
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Uh, no. No, I’m not hearing a voice.
60131
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Really? I see.
60132
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Haha... There you are. I... I’m doing fine. You got into... a lot of trouble because of me.
60133
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Catherine...!
60134
0
0
0

Catherine! It’s me! Your daddy!
60135

Catherine...
60136
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Catherine! Do you recognise me?
60137
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
No! No, Catherine!
60138
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Stop it.
60139
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Stop it... Catherine... Get some rest.
60140
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Catherine... I’m sorry... I’m so, so sorry!
60141
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Don’t worry. I’m all right.
60142
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Don’t blame yourself. You didn’t do anything wrong. Nor did Catherine. Nobody is to blame.
60143
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
If anybody is to blame...
60144
0

It’s this mad world.

60147

0
0
0
0
0
0
Huh? Awake already?\nMust be nice, being so young.
60148
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Well?\nWhat’s it like to open your eyes for the first time in 15 years?
60149
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
I mean, what does it feel like to sleep for 15 years and then finally awaken?
60150
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Hm, I can understand why you look so surprised.\nYou probably think I’m lying.
60151
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
But... Do you remember?\nThe world as you last saw it? That wolf...
60152
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
During the 15 years in which you slept, the world was destroyed.\nEverything was laid to waste and many people died.
60153

Today...\nsurvival is the biggest priority.

In this world, where the people are desperate,\nthere is a power which protects them.

Sparkling like the stars and protective like the forest...\nWe call ourselves the Starry Forest League.

The Starry Forest League has many duties, but its foremost is...\nto work with people like you.

The place where you slept... the Great Void.\nEvery now and then people emerge from it. They possess special powers.

Powers which let them survive in this crazy world... They possess SoulForce.\nWe call them SoulForcers. You are one of them.

Залезай.
Ну же, прыгай!
Проходи здесь, быстрее.
В эту сторону.
Всё, что тебе нужно сделать — это пройти здесь.
Тебе нужно пройти здесь.

60168
Ты почти на месте. Поспеши!
Живее, живее! Почти на месте.
Что ты едва ноги волочишь?
Уже близко. Спеши.
Exactly. Get your head out of the clouds! Come here!
Не далеко. Совсем не далеко.

C’mon fight. Find a home for your revenge.
All you need to do now is have fun.
Crush them all. Set the beast within you lose.
May this fierce force kindle your passion!
Even if it makes you sad... You must defeat it.
Get as angry as you like.\nFeel the rage building within. Smash everything!

Hey, there are more of them.\nDo you guys think there’s something strange about this, too?
60177
0

0
0
0
0
0
They don’t look as if they were searching for something.\nMore like they were expecting us.
60178

Don’t jump to conclusions.\nWe can only wait to be contacted.
60179

First we’ll take down that one straight ahead.\nChloe, support please.

They must have been outnumbered.\nAnd got annihilated. But if we can save even one of them, we will.
60181

0
0
0
0

All right. Then I’ll use my Dark Flame Master...\nto give you cover!

They were very far from the meeting point when it happened.\nWe have to assume the troops at the meeting point were killed too.

I’ll keep you covered. Got that?
60191

Anyone who isn’t fighting should stay back.\nI’ve forgotten how to look after weaklings in combat.
60192
0
0
0
0
0

0
I see.\nIf we get the timing wrong, the Gaour troop will probably spread out.
60193
0
0
0
0
0
0

Kill them and buy time for the Mountain Troll. Got that?
60194

Tell me.
60195

That means it needs to be activated manually.\nI am sorry, but that’s your job, young SoulWorker.

That is Ruin Fortress. It used to be a military fortress of the NED Company, but now it lies in ruins and is almost unusable.\nNobody looks after it, so we have no idea what to expect inside. Then there are the Blood SoulWorkers to consider.\nYou had better be on your guard at all times.
40002
This really is an iron fortress.\nIt’s pretty cold here, isn’t it?
As if a robot will suddenly rise up out of the ground.\nIs it too much to hope I’ll be on its back by pure coincidence?
Achoo! *ahem*\nWe seem to be surrounded by metal here.
Brrr, cold!\nHot chestnuts would sell here like... well, hot cakes.
Phewww! It’s cold! I’m going to freeze to death.\nAnd I feel even colder here because everything looks cold!
Is the Blood SoulWorker here? Ah... achoo!\nBrrrrr!

Did those robots just move of their own accord?\nAvon! Didn’t you say the facilities had been deactivated?
40006
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Yes, I did.\nProbably just the facilities, not the robots.
40007
0
0
0
0
0
0

That’s odd. Maybe their batteries are still powered?
40008
0
0

0
0
0
0
They seem to be a bit too aggressive for that.
40009
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
Maybe because they detected an intruder.\nWell, it can’t be helped. Get rid of them.
40010
Yes, all right.\nBut how do I fight robots?
Oh, come on.\nDon’t you know the three laws of robotics?
First mannequins, then monsters and now robots?\nThe world is a strange place.
How much is a kilo of iron anyway?
I’ve never played for a soulless audience before. \nFascinating!
Er, hello?\nYou’re fighting at half-speed, right?

How cute.
40016
A little child? But this form...\nIsn’t it dangerous?
I don’t know who built her,\nbut evidently he was a true gentleman.
I would like to ask him why he chose this particular form.
These evil AI, stealing jobs from hard-working people!
Where are you from?\nYou are similar to your friends, and yet different.
I don’t know who built you,\nbut this isn’t funny.

No... signature.\nThe shuttle is empty.

As soon as that’s done, we can attempt to hack into her.

How sad. All cute things in the world deserve to be protected.
I don’t like her face.\nDo you want me to try and make it look tortured?
I’ll stop them. Everyone has a right to work!
So you’re saying that if I destroy this, she’ll just be a drooling mess?\nAnd if I plug this back in, she’ll be smart again?
I don’t enjoy hurting children.\nBut it seems I have no choice.

Hmph. Stay just the way you are. I’ll take care of my own affairs.
Even if it concerns little kids! If they don’t die, we starve!
I don’t want to do this either. \nBut the old man said we don’t have a choice.

LXT? Oh, I heard about that during operator training.\nIt refers to things that easily surpass new technologies, even though they were created long ago.
40148
0
0
0
0
0
0

Exactly. The abbreviation stands for Lost Extra Technology. We don’t know where it’s from or who created it.\nIt is unknown technology in the truest sense of the word. The Buster Cores might be such a technology.

I don’t know who you are,\nbut you do a poor imitation of Chloe.
You don’t sound like her,\nso you might as well give up right now.
A terrible hobby.\nDo you have so little self-confidence that you have to copy others?
You! You’re not Chloe!\nI can hear it in your voice!
Who are you?\nStop trying to talk like Chloe. That makes me really angry!
Who are you?\nVoice impersonation not your forte, is it?

The way you talk!\nChloe sounds a lot more cute!
\nI’ve never heard such a bad impersonator as you.
It sounds like a guy who is trying to impersonate a woman’s voice!
You lack empathy. Who are you?
Hahaha. How brazen. You don’t sound anything like Chloe!\nHow about you show your true identity?

You’re absorbing the energy?\nI don’t understand what’s happening, but I should stop you...
You’re absorbing the energy...\nThat isn’t healthy, is it?
The energy... Are you absorbing it?\nWhy are you stealing it?
Abel, what are you doing?\nStop acting so suspiciously!
You’re absorbing the energy?   \nI’m supposed to stop you? Ah, I see.
You’re absorbing the energy?\nI’m not sure what it all means, but I’m not going to just sit by idle.

This sensation... It’s like it was back then!\nA Blood SoulWorker!
A new player!\nYou are just my type!
I will determine that,\nnot you.
Who... are you?\nWe haven’t met before, but please, step aside. I don’t want to hurt a woman!
You remind me of the guy who was with Henryk last time.\nYou’re a Blood.... something, too!
A Blood SoulWorker.\nFinally, we meet.

Out of my way! I need to talk to Abel.
Huh? Right now I don’t have the time.
You brat! You’re just a copy and you think you can stop me?
Her aura is much like that of a SoulWorkers.\nThis is no ordinary woman.
What’s up with this ‘Original’?
If you say so. You don’t have much time though.\nThis won’t take long.

You’re strong! But I can’t let you distract me!
If I give you my number, can we explore this together later?
Haha! I wonder what that arrogant face will look like when it’s scrunched up?
You are the strongest person that I have ever fought against!
So, am I brilliant or am I brilliant?
This is taking longer than I thought.\nYou’re not easy to defeat after all.

No, that’s no good! No matter how much you care about your work, always try to increase your value as well.\nIf all you do is work, you’ll wake up one day to find you’ve grown old. That would be sad, wouldn’t it?

Oh... Oh, oh! Amanda! She’s all weak.
If the sound of her name alone does that... \nDreadful. Hysterical woman.

Even if there is no end in sight, I’ll be running to the very end!\nAfter all, it’s great cardio!

Heh? Or did I win?
Hmph, it must have been those distracting clothes.
I’ve never heard an excuse like that before.
Here, wear this. No back talk!
Hm? That surprised me, too.\nWe’ll play together next time!
Oh, right. You’re overdoing it.\nSlow down.

Temperatures have dropped sharply. Maybe because the fortress was built in a gorge?\nReally cold.
40418
Yes, it’s freezing. It isn’t cold there?\nHow lovely for you, Chloe.
Come here if you want to know!\nSee for yourself if it’s cold or not.
Does anybody who works a warm desk job\neven know what cold feels like?
Yes, it is very cold here.\nYou always in an office, Chloe, that’s why you can’t picture it.
You always ask questions like that, Chloe. \nYou’re not coming along this time, either!
Yes. It’s cold. You have no idea how cold it is here.\nYou’ve got it easy! I envy you.

Abel, are you pestering us again?
Ahh. Hello! Come on, let’s play.
You keep popping up out of the blue.
You are packing quite a hefty arsenal for someone here for fun.
Hi Abel! Come on, let’s play.
Annoying kid! We seem to see each other quite a lot.

I’ll be going then.\nBut I’ll stop by occasionally!
40451
You won’t be so lucky next time!
Yeah, yeah. Come on, I’m always up for a game.
I don’t need to see your face again.
Sometimes the best way to get to know somebody is to fight them!
Yes! Take care! Until next time!
You running away again? Let’s finish this for once and for all!

Blood SoulWorkers... That’s odd.\nThey don’t seem that dangerous to me in a fight.
Blood SoulWorkers aren’t very committed enemies.\nI always thought they were stronger than the Bashai.
The Blood SoulWorkers are a good team.\nThey behave like they are a family.
Those Blood... something...\nTheir souls have been twisted, but they lead very normal lives.
These Blood SoulWorkers are like crazy kids.

Did you like reading mangas before the Great Void?\nIf so, which ones?
40541
I liked ‘I Need Money’.\nShouldn’t it be finished by now?
I liked ‘Chrome Mask’ and ‘The Green Tea Prince’.\nThey were romances, but true masterpieces.
I don’t like mangas.\nI prefer artistic works.
I give Radialman and Two-Punch Man a thumbs up!\nHaha, reading them was all vectors and close-shaves!
What’s that? Something like fairy tales? \nI like ‘The Swordfighter of Oz’ and ‘Elisabeth in Wonderland’!
Comics? No, thanks! I prefer my edition of the Cat Encyclopedia.

We’re going to continue with Operation Access Deep Core.\nYou’ll need to keep using the lift, so stick it out a bit longer.
40568
The lift, again?\nYuck, I feel sick.
I’m claustrophobic, but what the heck?
Next time I’ll take a chair with me.
Just like the time when I was a lift engineer!
How does this work? \nCan’t I just jump down there?
Never mind. If I can’t see the ground any more then it doesn’t matter how high it is.

40571
How deep does this go?\nThere’s still no end in sight.
Is this really the basement? It keeps going down.\nIt doesn’t go to the centre of the earth, does it?
It’s dark and musty here, and the air is bad.\nIt’s getting darker deeper below. When is it going to stop?
It’s only getting worse. I’m bored.\nAre we nearly there yet?
Old man... why? If I jump, will I end up like you?\nWouldn’t that be good?
I don’t know if I’m going up or down any more.\nIs there no way to find out when I’ll arrive?

Old man. Now that we’ve reached this point, isn’t it about time you gave an explanation?\nThe Deep Core... is it an LXT?
40587

I don’t know for sure either.\nThe NED Company just showed up with it one day.
40588

I presume you know that it’s energy has a different signature.\nIt’s output is decidedly different. So it might actually be LXT.

All of this is just for him.\nSo don’t try to stop us.

No! It’s too dangerous!\nI can’t allow you to use it!
I’m sorry, but you can’t do that.\nIt looks much too dangerous to me.
If you stop, I’ll think about it.
There’s other ways!\nStop this!
Hm... The old man says that what you are doing is much too dangerous.\nCan’t you just stop doing it?
Everyone has their reasons, I know.\nBut what you are doing... I cannot permit it.

Pretty big!\nAnd it looks fairly strong!
Haha, what is that supposed to be? A lamp?
These bootleggers always think of something.\nBut this time, they’ve gone too far!
You’re stronger!\nBut it seems you are at the end of your strength.

Honey!\nMaybe you shouldn’t sweat if you’re serious about this.
You look pretty worn out.\nAren’t you bragging too much?
Haha! What power!\nBut I can see that you are already exhausted.
Yes! Let’s stop fighting.\n...Hm? What, old man? You still haven’t?

40647

Lamps which never go out, ink which doesn’t dry... LXT is found in even the smallest consumables.\nThis technology used to be employed for all kinds of things.

Go on, send all the copies you’ve got!\nThey can’t beat the hero!
Go play in the junkyard!\nBlockheads!
I’ll take care of it. Just tell me where to go!
I’ve always been curious about this. Can you understand me? \nCan’t you talk?
Pity. I don’t feel like playing for time.

Shall I tell you a secret? Do you know about Chloe?\nDid you think she was a real person?

40671
0

No? You worked together so closely and yet you don’t even know what her face looks like.\nIs there a reason for that? The most likely one is that she isn’t human.

Just see how she reacted. She’s hiding something.\nSo don’t trust her too much, Original.
40674
Abel... Even if you’re right and Chloe\nis not really human...
You have a complete lack of manners, boy.\nYou’re always interfering!
What do you mean?\nDo you want to meddle in my life, too?
I’m speaking the truth.
You think you can’t trust somebody, just because you can’t see them?\nThat’s rubbish, Abel.
That’s funny.\nShe puts up with so much, including my temper. Is Chloe not human?
0
0
40677
But everything that happened between us\nis real and not a lie.
A human who laughs with me, gets angry and cries is supposed to be an AI?\nIf you say so. That sort of AI is welcome any time.
Who cares if she’s a real person or an AI?\nI trust Chloe utterly.
I don’t care if Chloe is an AI or otherwise.\nI’m on her side!
I don’t have to see her myself to like her and trust her. \nWhat matters is what I feel, not what I see.
Endurance: it is a virtue exclusive to humans.\nA virtue... or a curse.
0
0
40680
She’s my comrade and was always at my side.\nSo you don’t need to go telling me that sort of thing.
Mind your own business and leave me alone.
I like her. And you have no right to interfere like that.
So you can say what you want. Nothing has changed for me. Got it?
She trusted me and likes me.\nAnd that makes Chloe my friend. A friend whom I trust.
In that respect, you assume wrongly. Stop that nonsense.

Hmph. Unusual language.\nIs somebody impersonating you again?
Haha. No. That’s a given.\nI think that Chloe might not be an AI but actually an android!

Ahh! Just leave this to me!\nMessing with other people’s business is my specialty!
A single human will start the apocalypse?\nI find that highly unlikely.

One, two, three, four...\nThere are too many of them! And now?
More insects?
Ha! They are just flies!
Are there a lot of robots?\nThey’d make good transporters.

Those are attack bugs.\nGross.

It isn’t easy. I’ve used up nearly all my energy.\nIs it because it’s the Original?

It’s really strong.\nBut I can win! I have got to win!
Why don’t you give up?\nI’m beginning to feel sorry for you!
You’re just a copy\nand so bad it makes me bored!
Give up!
Can’t you just let me\nsee Abel then?
You look shattered. Is everything all right?\nMaybe you should give up.

We cannot let you disturb him.\nAs his big sister, I want to make my little brother’s wish come true!
40761
I’m afraid I’ll have to stop Abel anyway!
As his big brother, I need to teach him\nthat it’s not always about him!
Will you make my wish come true as well?\nMy wish to slice you into pieces?
Words are not working.\nSeems I will have to force good fortune on you!
I’m sorry. But something terrible is going to happen if I don’t stop him. \nI can’t let that happen!
I can’t allow it!\nI need to correct you!

I’ll start with Major Toru’s message.\nKeep an eye on Avon, who was dispatched there. He has a devious mind, which makes him very dangerous. You’d best stay clear of him.
40786
That doesn’t sound very convincing.
He’s the last person who should say something like that.
It takes one to know one, huh?
Hmm, I don’t know...
Old man? Why? You want me to watch out for both of them? Yeah?
Yes, the aura was that of a criminal.

Captain Ava.\nWhat is she up to all the time?
She’s really scary.\nI guess she has to be.
She is the source of everyone’s nightmares, after all.\nMaybe I should copy her.
Perhaps it would be better not to get involved in this.
A... Amanda! Amanda’s soul is waving from the great beyond. It’s a trap! Don’t go!
What kind of a woman is that?

It’s just a pinch of pain.\nIt was definitely not a crit. You’ll soon be on your feet again.
Yes.

Oh, no.\nI won’t be able to defeat her. Haha.
Don’t come any closer!
I don’t see anything positive in this situation!
Are you the one everybody was afraid of? Suzie.\nSomething vast in the soul... I... I’m scared!
What on earth is that?\nThis armour... is that the prototype?

So this is a spaceship.\nIt looks different to the pictures in my books. Gigantic.
An aircraft that can fly in space.\nAs if it’s about to lift off.
A spaceship in times like these...\nOnly a megalomaniac would try to make it beautiful.
A spaceship... I bet this material was expensive.
Old man, I’ve been thinking...\nYou are used to flying, aren’t you? With helicopters and planes...
A spaceship...\nA spaceship should be okay, even if you’re afraid of heights, right?

It would be too bad about such a big thing.\nWhat is this Suzie up to?
But this is what makes it so much fun.\nThe time we’re living in, I mean.
But the ambition with which they pursue their megalomaniac projects...\npraiseworthy indeed.
I wonder if anyone will notice if I move a bit away from here?
Can we fly with the spaceship?\nIt should be like normal flying!
To get to space you have to reach beyond the skies.\nIt’s not for me.

Isn’t it? SoulWorkers might be able to recover really fast,\nbut they feel pain just like we do.\nIf they suffer burns, you can’t see the injuries but they feel the pain for as long as we do.\nIsn’t that awful?

Once it is fully charged, it will emit a massive shockwave of energy.\nThat wave doesn’t care if you are friend or foe. When I give you the signal, you have to dive for the barrier in the middle!

Uh, yes? I don’t know any specifics... Just that it’s a big city.
It’s got lots of pretty women, right? But none as pretty as you, Chloe.
The most important area in the east. Is there anything special about it?
It should be a large city! And...
Grace? What’s that?
Yes. I’ve heard of it.\nThe biggest city in west Cloudream.

The strength to face these creatures in combat...\nIt will never leave you.
This is your power, brother. A power that will never leave you and that you will always love.
Let it out, let it all out, everything you have hidden away so carefully, even from yourself.\nFor that will be the source of your SoulForce until the end of time.
The strength for that which smoulders in your heart.\nThe power that helps you to carry on living.
Exactly. Play with the friends you’ve known for so long.\nThis game will protect you and your friends.
This power... It will lead you to your destiny.\nChannel your unbridled rage through it.

Apart from the fact they are pretty powerful,\nthey are rather normal.
They aren’t fighting for their lives.\nAnd they seem to be quite nice.
They have a sense of humour and aren’t aggressive.\nCan we even call them enemies?
I don’t like to fight people for no reason.
They remind me of old men.\nAnd they’re similar to me.
It’s fun to watch them.\nIf we weren’t enemies, we’d probably get on well.

Woah! How weird!\nYour voice echoing through my head!

But they attacked us first.\nI’ll keep on fighting them.
