<font color='#FFBA85'>(Community) Can be used in the city limits. You sit comfortably on the floor to rest. Regenerates 1 EP per minute. Lasts: 60 min<font color='#9D927B'>\n\nPeople have always sat or laid down so they can rest. People often do this on the ground, which is normally dirty. It’s not terribly nice, of course. That’s why this mat was invented which you can sit on anywhere and thus rest with no issues. You can’t lie down, though.

It heals hearts and makes people dance with joy. Even though it isn’t live, the sounds from the radio count as music too. The most important part remains unchanged. Music should play for you who are weary from battle, because I want to tell you: fighting is not worth the effort! Soak up my music instead!

You use it exactly as it was intended!\n- A lively voice that chimes out of nowhere -

Thus the instrument became this mighty weapon.\n\nShe loved me, she thought of me, she sang for me. But I left her in the lurch. I cannot redeem that act even in death. I leave behind the image of my beloved.\n- Wandering Minstrel -

This effect is so strong that it has been scientifically tested, but without success so far.\n\nAnyone of sound mind refuses to use this weapon. Since the sheer existence of this weapon represented a great danger for the SoulDregs, it was situated at the village entrance as a totem. Unfortunately, in that spot it became a fly catcher.\n- SW Researcher -

War Machine Chest Guard
<font color='#FFBA85'>Equipment: Chest Guard<font color='#9D927B'>\n\nThe gear of a SoulWorker. This armour was specially made for combat against machines. Its performance alone is impressive enough. The disruptive effect generated using SoulForce also confuses machines. \n\nMassive interference waves... I’m getting really dizzy. Don’t get too close to me with that thing!\n- Amanda -

<font color='#FFBA85'>Equipment: Chest Guard<font color='#9D927B'>\n\nThe gear of a SoulWorker.

I wonder what that means? Perhaps it means you cannot succeed in life without enduring pain and effort.\n- Toru -

Tera Healing Gel
