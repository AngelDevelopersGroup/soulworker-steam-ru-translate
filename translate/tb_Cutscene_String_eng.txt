Ah! Why did I want to become a doctor?
100102
Because I wanted to help people, obviously! Hehe!
100103
Mummy! Mummy! I did it! I even got top marks!
100104
Warning! Warning! Return immediately to the bunker!
100105
I repeat! Return immediately to the bunker!
100106
Oh, mummy... please hold on! I’ll get you out of there.
100107
We’ll make it, mummy... no! Please! NOOO!!!
100201
How on earth do you win the big developers’ prize at the age of just 18?
100202
That must’ve happened while I wasn’t paying attention. I can catch big fish in my sleep!
100203
This amazing game, written by a regular high-school student, has occupied the top spot for 20 weeks!
100204
One of the 100 most influential people on the planet, he refused every interview till this very day.
100205
Oh man. Oh god, this world is such a bore.
100206
The Great Void... grand cities destroyed... millions killed or missing...
100207
Great Void... well that is something new. We should take a closer look at that.
100208
How dreadfully... exciting! What are you exactly? Tell me!
100209
Come on, out with it!
100210
Alright, fine! Swallow me up then. I’ll find out myself!
100301
Do you mean that thing which appeared here nearby?
100302
I don’t know what that is exactly.
100303
But I have something else I need to tell you! I went shopping today and...
100304
Err, what’s going on?
100305
How come it’s so loud in the middle of the night?
100306
Ah, huh?! Aaaaah! No!
100307
Hey! Who are you?!
100308
Spit him out! Give me back my brother! Argh!
100309
*sob* Aaaaah!
100310
Ha... ha... Hahaha! Ahahahaha!
100401
Three months have passed since the Great Void appeared.
100402
The Great Void... grand cities destroyed... millions killed or missing...
100403
Are we really safe here?
100404
Yes, this is a safe zone. I promise!
100405
All right... I trust you.
100406
Well then! I’ve been a member of the rescue team for 2 months and have nothing but accolades to my name! Hahaha!
100407
The Great Void! The Great Void! The Great Void has appeared... in our safe haven!
100408
But you said we’d be safe here! Wh-wh-why...?
100409
It’s all... because of me... It’s all my fault!
100410
I have to save them. I have to!
100411
Don’t go! You’ll die!
100412
Waaaaah!
100501
Why did you come to our village?
100502
You brought a curse on them! They’re dead because of you!
100503
N... no, it’s not... my fault.
100504
Why would you say such a thing?
100505
Is it really my fault? Maybe I should just go...
100506
I am so sorry. Now I’m all alone again.
100507
Old man, will we be alone there as well?
100508
After all, there’s no one there to hate me.
100509
I don’t want to be sad any more.
100601
Iris! Don’t even think about going out to play!
100602
But my friends are waiting for me...
100603
I’m about to lose my cool!
100604
Alright, fine, I understand.
100605
Why can’t you be more like your sisters?!
100606
But the scumbag messed with my friend Marie!
100607
Why can’t you be more like your sisters?!
100608
Why must you always go dragging the name of the Yuma clan through the mud?
100609
But I don’t want to be like them!
100610
I don’t need a family. I wish you’d all just disappear!
100611
Warning! Warning! Return immediately to the bunker!
100612
I repeat! Return immediately to the bunker!
100613
Wh-what the...?
100614
Noooo! Mummy! Daddy! Sisters!
100615
Waaaaah!
100616
I didn’t really mean it!
100617
Why did you make them all disappear?!
100618
You evil scoundrel!
101001
You’ll wake up in another world.
101002
There’s no place for normality in this world any more.
101003
You have the power to change this world.
101004
Denounce those who threaten this world!
201001
Hurry! You’re being pursued by a Malevil.
201101
You are me and I am you...
201102
I swore an oath to protect you!
201103
Remember that. You are me and I am you.
201104
Promise me one thing. Promise that you will find me.
201201
We are one, and yet we are two. We are two, though still we are one.
201202
I swore an oath to protect you!
201203
Remember that. We belong together.
201204
Please find me as quickly as you can. Promise!
201301
You and I are one and the same. We coexist together.
201302
I swore an oath to protect you!
201303
Remember that. You and I are one and the same.
201304
Please find me quickly. I’ll never forgive you if you come too late.
201401
You are me. I am you. We exist together as one.
201402
I made a solemn promise to protect you!
201403
Never forget. We belong together.
201404
Remember that! Find me! Do you understand?
201501
We arrived in this world as two, but we remain one and can only exist together.
201502
I made a solemn promise to protect you!
201503
Remember that! We are one!
201504
Promise that you will look for me.
201601
You and I are one and the same.
201602
I made a solemn promise to protect you!
201603
Never forget that. You and I belong together.
201604
I’m begging you. You have to find me.
201002
What on earth...!
201003
Hey quit moping, pull yourself together!
202001
What are you doing?
202002
Edgar! You’re here!
202003
Flood this world with your mannequins and become their king!
202004
No. Let me.
202005
Huh?!
202006
I don’t want to be king.
202007
I’m just a humble entertainer, a clown. It’s my job to make ‘her’ laugh.
202008
Edgar, what are you saying?
202009
I should never have given you an ego.
202010
I don’t like your methods. They are abhorrent.
202011
Edgar... err... Edgar?!
203101
Do you want to save that child?
203102
The only thing we can do for her is help her to find peace.
203103
If you swear to stay with me to the end of days, I will give you my power.
203104
You could use that power to help her find peace.
203105
I promise! Give me your power.
203106
No more!
203107
You are now bound by your promise.
203108
Aaaah!
203201
Hey, you! Need any help?
203202
I have something good for you. The power to help the child find peace.
203203
But nothing in this world is free.
203204
Do you promise to stay with me forever?
203205
Then I will impart my considerable powers to you.
203206
Well? What do you say?
203207
I promise!
203208
Give me your power!
203209
I knew you would say yes. You are now bound by your promise!
203210
Waaaaah!
203301
The child simply won’t die. Can you put an end to it?
203302
Such a crying shame! You’ll never manage with your current power!
203303
Promise me. Tell me you want this power.
203304
Do that and I’ll give you the power you need to kill this child.
203305
Fine. Give me the power!
203306
All right. You have made your eternal promise.
203307
Aaaah!
203401
Do you want to save that girl over there?
203402
You know what you have to do.
203403
You can only help her by gifting her eternal peace.
203404
If you give me your eternal promise, I’ll give you the power you need.
203405
I promise! And may the blame rest on my soul!
203406
As you wish. Your promise is now binding.
203407
Waaaaah!
203501
I warned you. I told you it would hurt.
203502
If you do nothing, the child will only suffer ever more. You don’t want that... do you?
203503
Give me your promise. Swear an oath, and you’ll get the power.
203504
You can free that child of its agony!
203505
I’ll do it. I’ll do anything you want!
203506
Just make it stop!
203507
Good. Swear that eternal oath, here and now!
203601
The child can never return.
203602
The only hope we have is to grant it eternal rest.
203603
If you want to put an end to this torment, you’ll have to swear an oath.
203604
Say you want to have this power.
203605
Yes, give it to me! I promise, just give me the power!
203606
I’ll take everything you can give me!
203607
Our contract is now sealed.
203608
Now fight as you see fit.
203609
Waaaaah!
203001
Thanks.
204001
Suzie, we meet at last.
205001
No, Suzie. Get up! Wake up, Suzie...
205002
Suzie!
206001
Stop it, you creature from another world.
206002
You shouldn’t be here.
206003
Return to the Void!
206004
The time nears. The time when you will be awakened.
206005
Noooo!
206006
The time has come for the wheels to turn.
206007
Let us only hope you do not fail.
